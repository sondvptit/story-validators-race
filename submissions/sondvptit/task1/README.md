# **About me:**
-> I am Lake Herd!

-> I am a new Technical Leader with 10 years of experience in the field of software technology and computer networks.

-> I have known crypto and blockchain for the past 2 years. I have experience in this field now. I know how to optimize the validator to run better and more stable!

# **My experience:**
I currently operate validator nodes for multiple blockchain networks: 

- 0gchain: https://testnet.explorer.liveraven.net/zero-gravity/staking/0gvaloper1zql9rp9yp7vtfkj2lydj93vgu39jw9scs0hxym
- Chainbase Network AVS: https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/operator/0xe5584f7b2af999c494cDC8441d6E86536EBA0697
- Story: https://testnet.story.explorers.guru/validator/B5DCE48D25A8C24F79E5E861DE6EDB7CE44D6659

=> I have maintained good performance in 0gChain project with 4 consecutive times in Top 121 validators!

=> My focus is on maintaining high uptime, ensuring optimal performance, while contributing to network security and decentralization and I am always checking the system 24/7!
